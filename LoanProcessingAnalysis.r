# FURTHER ANALYSIS 
# This section is used to examine if there is gender discrimination in the loan processing procedure
# drop missing rows
gender.homeloan <- homeloan.dt[Gender1 != "missing", ! "Loan_ID"]

# Gender and Loan_Status:
ggplot(gender.homeloan, aes(x= Gender1, y=Loan_Status)) + geom_jitter() + labs(title = "Gender and Loan Status")
# more males have approved loans, however this disparity could be due to the difference in number of applicants from both genders
# to test this assumption, I checked the number of males and females in the dataset
gender.homeloan[Gender1 == "Male", .N] #470
gender.homeloan[Gender1 == "Female", .N] #109
# assumption is true -> significantly more males than females
# use stacked bar chart to view results based on percentage instead of nominal number
ggplot(gender.homeloan, aes(x = Gender1, fill=Loan_Status)) + geom_bar(position="fill")  + labs(title = "Stacked Chart Gender and Loan Status")
gender.homeloan[Gender1 == "Female" & Loan_Status == "Y", .N]
gender.homeloan[Gender1 == "Male" & Loan_Status == "Y", .N]
# About 70% of Males and 67% of Females have their loans approved. Since this is a negligible difference, it debunks the claim that there is gender discrimination in the loan approval process.

# Gender, Credit_Score & Loan_Status:
ggplot(gender.homeloan, aes(x = Gender1, fill=Loan_Status)) + geom_bar(position="fill")  + labs(title = "Gender, Credit Score and Loan Status") + facet_grid(~ Credit_Score1)
# Furthermore, applicants from both genders with the same credit score are as likely to have their loans approved or denied, with Females being only a few percentage points behind.

# Hence, my overall findings corroborates the view that the loan approval process is not discriminatory towards Females or Males.
